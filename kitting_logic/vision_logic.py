"""
"Is this item on the table?" logic — no ROS, no hardware dependency.

Each item is identified by a class name (configured in
config/checklists.yaml under item_classes), and we call it "present" if
some detector — a locally trained YOLOv8 model, or a hosted Roboflow
model called over the network, or both combined via CompositeDetector —
reports that class with at least the configured confidence. This replaced
an earlier HSV colour-blob approach, which broke down under lighting
changes and couldn't tell two same-coloured items apart.

Two ways to get a working detector for an item, see the README's
"Training the YOLOv8 model" section for the full steps:

  A) Use an existing public model over Roboflow's hosted inference API
     (RoboflowAPIDetector) — no local training at all. Needs an API key
     in config/secrets.yaml's roboflow.api_key (free, from
     app.roboflow.com/settings/api) and a model_id in
     config/checklists.yaml's roboflow.model_id.
  B) Train your own local model (YoloDetector) from photos — your own
     captures (tools/capture_training_images.py) and/or a public dataset,
     merged in Roboflow and exported/trained locally. Point
     config/checklists.yaml's yolo.weights at the resulting best.pt.

build_detector() wires up whichever of these are configured (both is
fine — different items can come from different backends) and raises
DetectorNotConfigured with setup steps if neither is available, rather
than silently detecting nothing.

    <3.13 (no wheel for 3.14+ at time of writing), which would make this
