# Vision-Verified Kitting & Sorting Robot

A robot scans a QR code to pick a task mode, checks with computer vision that
the right items are physically present, emails an alert for anything missing,
and then runs the pick-and-place with a Dobot Magician once the kit is
complete.

See [`docs/Dobot_Kitting_Sorting_Robot_Presentation.pdf`](docs/Dobot_Kitting_Sorting_Robot_Presentation.pdf)
for the original project proposal (problem statement, architecture, timeline,
team). Note the proposal specs WhatsApp/Twilio for notifications — the build
below uses plain email instead (see "What's already done"), since it needs no
Twilio account, sandbox, or phone verification.

## What's already done (built and tested tonight, no ROS or hardware needed)

Everything under `kitting_logic/` is plain Python — no ROS, no Dobot, no
lab camera required. It's tested: run `python3 test/test_logic.py` and you
should see 10/10 passed. This is the actual brains of the project:

- `qr_logic.py` — reads a QR code from a camera frame
- `checklist_logic.py` — looks up what's required for a given mode
- `vision_logic.py` — checks whether an item is visible in a frame, using a
  YOLOv8 object detector (see "Training the YOLOv8 model" below)
- `notify_logic.py` — sends (or fakes sending) an email alert when items are missing
- `dobot_logic.py` — moves the arm, with a **simulated** version that just
  logs what it would do, so you can run the whole thing without the arm

Notifications go by email, not SMS/WhatsApp — no Twilio account, sandbox,
or phone verification needed. Just your own email address and a Gmail
"app password" (see `config/secrets.example.yaml` for the exact steps).

## What's left for tomorrow

1. Get this onto the lab's Ubuntu machine (or your own laptop if it runs
   Ubuntu) — see "Getting this onto the lab machine" below.
2. Install ROS 1 Noetic if it isn't already there.
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` on that machine too (this now
   includes `ultralytics`, which pulls in PyTorch — a much bigger install
   than before, budget a few extra minutes).
4. Jog the real arm to find your actual coordinates, and put them in
   `config/coordinates.yaml` (it currently has placeholder numbers).
5. Train a YOLOv8 model on your actual sorting items under the lab's
   actual lighting — see "Training the YOLOv8 model" below (do this even
   if you trained one tonight at home — lighting changes what the model
   needs to see).
6. Copy `config/secrets.example.yaml` to `config/secrets.yaml` and fill in
   your real email + app password (see comments in that file).
7. Run it:
   ```
   roslaunch kitting_robot kitting.launch                        # simulated arm, safe default
   roslaunch kitting_robot kitting.launch simulate:=false port:=/dev/ttyUSB0   # real arm
   ```

Nothing else changes between simulation and the real run — same code,
same launch file, one flag.

## Running the logic tonight, without ROS

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 test/test_logic.py                 # confirm everything passes (no model needed)
python3 demo_integration.py                # walk the pipeline with no camera or model needed
python3 demo_integration.py --webcam       # real webcam + real YOLO model, end to end
```

`demo_integration.py --webcam` and the ROS `perception_node` both need a
trained model at `config/checklists.yaml`'s `yolo.weights` path (default
`models/best.pt`) — see "Training the YOLOv8 model" below. Without one,
they fail immediately with a clear error rather than silently detecting
nothing. `test/test_logic.py` and the no-camera `demo_integration.py`
don't need a model at all — they use a fake detector.

## Training the YOLOv8 model

The color-blob approach (matching a fixed HSV range) was swapped for a
real YOLOv8 object detector, since colour matching broke down under
lighting changes and couldn't tell two same-coloured items apart.

All three items are covered by public datasets now, so no self-captured
photos are strictly required — though `tools/capture_training_images.py`
is still there if your actual objects don't resemble either dataset
closely enough and you need to add real photos on top:

- **red_block / blue_block**:
  [colored-blocks](https://universe.roboflow.com/autonomous-object-picking-robot/colored-blocks)
  (CC BY 4.0, 513 images, classes `red`/`green`/`blue`, 98.9% mAP@50).
- **sharpener**:
  [Stationary Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahsami10/stationary-dataset)
  (CC BY 4.0, pre-split train/valid/test, classes `Pencil`/`Eraser`/`Sharpener`/`Ruler`).

That's why `config/checklists.yaml` points `red_block`/`blue_block`/`sharpener`
at classes `red`/`blue`/`Sharpener` — each dataset's own class names, so you
don't have to relabel their images. A single model needs one consistent
set of classes though, so the two sources need merging into one dataset:

1. On Roboflow, open the [colored-blocks
   dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/autonomous-object-picking-robot/colored-blocks)
   and click **Fork Dataset** into your own (free) workspace — this copies
   its 513 labelled red/green/blue images into a project you can edit.
2. Download the [Stationary
   Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahsami10/stationary-dataset)
   from Kaggle (Download button, or `kaggle datasets download -d
   abdullahsami10/stationary-dataset` with the Kaggle CLI) and unzip it —
   it's already in YOLO format with `images/`/`labels/` folders.
3. In that same forked Roboflow project, use **Upload Dataset** to import
   the Kaggle images + YOLO labels — Roboflow matches classes by name, so
   this adds `Pencil`/`Eraser`/`Sharpener`/`Ruler` alongside the existing
   `red`/`green`/`blue`. The extra classes you don't need (green, pencil,
   eraser, ruler) are harmless to leave in — the project's `item_classes`
   just never references them.
4. Generate a new dataset version and export it in **YOLOv8** format —
   this gives you one `data.yaml` plus labelled image folders covering
   every class from both sources.
5. Train: `yolo detect train data=data.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=50 imgsz=640`
   — ultralytics prints the resulting weights path when done, usually
   `runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt`.
6. Copy that file to `models/best.pt` (or wherever `config/checklists.yaml`'s
   `yolo.weights` points). Double-check the exact class name casing in the
   exported `data.yaml` matches `item_classes` in `config/checklists.yaml`
   — YOLO class names are case-sensitive.

If your actual objects don't look enough like either dataset (different
block colour/shape, different sharpener), capture and label your own
photos instead — run `tools/capture_training_images.py red_block
blue_block sharpener`, add them to the same Roboflow project under your
own class names, and point `item_classes` at those instead.

Both datasets are CC BY 4.0 — attribution is required if you use them.
Roboflow's project page has a ready-made citation under "Cite This
Project"; the Kaggle page has an equivalent under its metadata section.
Include both in your final report/slides.

Neither the trained weights nor any captured/downloaded photos are
committed to git (see `.gitignore`) — they're per-lab, per-lighting build
artifacts, not source.

If `pyzbar` fails to install (it needs a system library called `libzbar`
that pip can't install by itself on Linux — Windows usually just works),
the QR code will still work — the code automatically falls back to
OpenCV's built-in QR reader (see `kitting_logic/qr_logic.py`).

One QR-printing tip that actually mattered when testing this: print your
QR codes at a reasonable size (a few cm across) with a plain white margin
around them — a QR code with no white border around it, or a screenshot
cropped too tightly, is much harder for either decoder to read.

Ready-made test codes are included: [`MODE_1.png`](MODE_1.png) and
[`MODE_2.png`](MODE_2.png) encode `MODE_1`/`MODE_2` directly — print or
display either one to trigger that mode without generating your own.

## Getting this onto the lab machine

Easiest: push this to a GitHub repo tonight, then on the lab machine:

```
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/catkin_ws/src/kitting_robot
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

(If you don't already have a catkin workspace on the lab machine, `mkdir
-p ~/catkin_ws/src` first, then clone into it as above.)

## Keeping secrets out of git

`config/secrets.yaml` holds your real Gmail address and app password — it's
listed in `.gitignore` and must never be committed. Only
`config/secrets.example.yaml` (a template with placeholder values) is
tracked. If you ever regenerate the Gmail app password in `secrets.yaml`
(e.g. because it was accidentally shared), revoke the old one at
[myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
